The one and only app you would ever need to stay motivated ðŸ¥°. ProAct can be classified to be a standalone `App` ðŸ˜‰, unique and efficient `Tools` meant to give you motivation at the right time ðŸ”¥.

As the codejam theme implies `Make Everyday a Little Less Ordinary`, I was able to `translate` and `understand` this theme with an application which is meant to make the end user `Motivated`, `Active` and `Productive`.

What makes this application standouts from the rest is that, it doesnt provide this complex features `Motivational Quotes`, , `Mood`, on different platforms, but rather provides all these features on it own. Also consist of an `onboarding` chatbot which get you into the app using some interactive UI comonents ðŸ¥°.
